\usage{
get_sigcell_simple(
  knn_sparse_mat = mutualknn30,
  topidx = seed_p0.05,
  permutation_times = 1000,
  true_cell_significance = 0.05,
  out_rda = "true_cell_df.rda",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{knn_sparse_mat}{a sparse matrix used for network propagation, which indicates the adjacent matrix (m x m, where m is the cell number) of cell-to-cell network (M-kNN graph)}

\item{topidx}{a logical vector indicating seed cells (TRUE) and non-seed cells (FALSE) with length of m, where m is the cell number. The length and position are corresponding to knn_sparse_mat}

\item{permutation_times}{an integer describe times of permutation test for each cell}

\item{true_cell_significance}{a numeric value between 0-1 indicating the significant threshold used to determine statistically trait-enriched cell}

\item{out_rda}{path and name for resulting r.data}

\item{mycores}{how many cores used for permutation test}

\item{rw_gamma}{gamma from randomWalk_sparse function. Keep the same with what you used in the real setting}
}
\value{
a dataframe with two columns, the first one is seed index (the same with input), the second one is significance from permutation test. In addition, an R data is generated, which contains this dataframe and another dataframe depicting the network propagation score for each cell at each permuation
}
\description{
a function to determine statistically trait-enriched cell by permutation test
